This is the official GitHub Repository of the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). The MSTG is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security testing and reverse engineering. It describes technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the [OWASP Mobile Application Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs "MASVS").

Before you start contributing, please check our [contribution guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md "Contribution Guide") which should get you started. If you have any doubts [please contact us](#connect-with-us).

### Contribution Credit / Acknowledgments

Contributors are added to the acknowledgments section based on their contributions logged by GitHub and/or by applying to a certain role and consistently demonstrating their commitment. Acknowlegements are visible in the [official owasp.org Project Page](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/#div-acknowledgements), in [GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x02-Frontispiece.md#acknowledgments), [GitBook](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/0x02-frontispiece#acknowledgments) and in the [printed versions](https://www.lulu.com/shop/sven-schleier-and-jeroen-willemsen-and-bernhard-m%C3%BCller/owasp-mobile-security-testing-guide/paperback/product-24198359.html).

Contributors are categorized as follows:

- **Project Leader / Author**: Manage the development of the guide continuously and write a large amount of new content. Project Leadership cannot be achieved if any violations of the Code of Conduct occurred in the past. Be aware that you'll be expected to invest lots of time over several months.
- **Reviewer**: People that continuously monitor and review our [Pull Requests](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/pulls) or given useful feedback and suggesting changes.
- **Most Helpful Discussions contributor**: actively participate in our GitHub Discussions. Contributors with the most answers marked as "The Answer" will get recognized as "Most Helpful" in our official repos.
- **Co-Author**: Consistently contribute quality content, [at least 2,000 additions logged](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/graphs/contributors "Co-author").
- **Top Contributor**: Consistently contribute quality content, [at least 500 additions logged](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/graphs/contributors "Top Contributor").
- **Contributor**: Any form of contribution, [at least 50 additions logged](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/graphs/contributors "Contributor").
- **Mini-contributor**: Everything below 50 additions, e.g. committing a single word or sentence.

[Contact us](#connect-with-us) (Sven Schleier (Slack: *Sven*) or Carlos Holguera (Slack: *Carlos*)) if you are planning to become an Author/Co-Author/Reviewer, are missing from the acknowledgements (note that we make updates frequently, but not in realtime).

## MSTG Translations

The MSTG is a living document that changes and adapts to the most recent security recommendations every day. While we do want to reach the maximum audience possible, our past experience shows that **maintaining translations has proven to be an extremely challenging task**. Therefore, please understand that **any PRs containing MSTG translations will be declined**, but you're free to do them on your own forks.

> 🇯🇵 A translation of the MSTG into Japanese is available on Github: <https://github.com/coky-t/owasp-mstg-ja>. Thanks to @coky-t for pushing this forward!

That said, we **strongly encourage [further translations of the MASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/blob/master/README.md#masvs-translations)** as it is much easier to maintain and you'll get a translated [Mobile App Security Checklists](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/releases/latest) mapping to the MSTG for free.

## About Hybrid Apps

Please note that the MSTG focuses primarily on native apps. These are apps built with Java or Kotlin using the Android SDK for Android or built with Swift or Objective-C using the Apple SDKs for iOS. Apps using frameworks such as Nativescript, React-native, Xamarin, Cordova, etc. are not within the main focus of the MSTG. However, some essential controls, such as certificate pinning, have been explained already for some of these platforms.
